Analytical software is a tool, a means to an end. Understanding principles behind data science, grasping the meaning of your data and knowing how it may support decisive action is the main job of a data scientist.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to have a set of tools that you feel comfortable with. In this course we work with R, a statistical programming language that is free, easy to learn and comes with a large repository of free libraries that help you to work with your data in different ways.

In this chapter we will guide you through the installation of R on your local computer and how to install packages. Next we will show how to set up an analytics RStudio Server in the AWS cloud.
