\noindent{\textbf{About the workshop and this manual:}} \\

Welcome to ``An introduction to applied data science'' a 5-day original workshop thought and written by Eduardo Barbaro and Coen Jonker. At the end of this week you will be able to (i) understand the basics of data science, (ii) mathematically describe data, and (iii) munge\footnote{describes the constructive operation of tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate} it into an easy and communicable form. As the course develops, we will teach you how to access and look at data in innovative ways, as well as to extract value from big data. We aim a significant part of this training to help you create and interpret a diverse set of numerical models, as well as to calculate descriptive analytics while fully understanding their meaning. We also focus on presentation, and how to show your results in beautiful smart charts and tables.

Although all the computations will be performed in a cloud environment, we will guide you through all the necessary steps to install any software necessary for this course in your local machines. We take advantage of a cloud computing environment to get to run our code in a fast, secure, and controlled domain.

This manual is divided in 11 independent short chapters. In Chapter \ref{DS} we set the stage with a short introduction to then answer together a bold question: ``what is data science?''. In Chapter \ref{basics} we will spend some time to recap some basic mathematical concepts needed throughout the entire workshop. Chapters \ref{P1} and \ref{P2} are devoted to (important) practicalities, such as installing software/libraries and getting familiar with the cloud environment. We also teach you some basic programming skills, so we are all on the same page. We move forward to our first data harvest, in Chapter \ref{harvesting}. We teach you how to manipulate data, as well as to properly describe and clean it. Chapter \ref{numerics} covers the basics of designing a smart numerical experiment. 

Chapters \ref{MLearn} to \ref{bigData} cover more advanced topics such as machine learning tools, databases (SQL and no-SQL) as well as a mapreduce implementation (Hadoop). In particular, in Chapter \ref{bigData} we show in detail how to load, transform, and extract value from real big data. Finally, in Chapter \ref{Commun} we come back to basics to show you rudiments of plotting and how to communicate your results. 

We wish you a pleasant learning!
